SourceGeography
===============

This repo contains Shilad's source code for the Summer 2014 Wikipedia Source Geography project with Heather Ford, Dave Musicant, Brent Hecht, and Mark Graham.

In addition to the source and data files in this file, a variety of large data files are needed from our [Google Drive Data Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/macalester.edu/#folders/0BzlDGhkHWrbfUWNmclpoWFJ0dnc) (TODO: make this public).

These files are: 

 * urls.txt.bz2 - All external urls from GeoSpatial Wikipedia articles in all languages.
